I realize it's been a long time since I posted to my blog but I have good reasons...

<br>Since the middle of March, I've been honing my skills in Android development with the aim of ultimately deploying Hiya (the chat application I discuss in other blog posts), and becoming a professional Android developer. This is the direction I want to move forward in - **Android development**. 

<br>I've experimented with a number of technologies and libraries to achieve these goals but it will take more time before Iâ€™m comfortable and ready to build Hiya. I want to make sure Hiya is built with clean, well-structured code that uses the latest libraries and best practices. In the meantime, I've pushed a few Android apps to my GitHub account and for now; Hiya's development is suspended as I continue to work on these smaller projects. I have a lot of time to improve my skills in Android development given the current global situation and I feel good about my progress so far. 

<br>When I first started this blog, I wasn't sure what type of developer I wanted to be. But now I know. I look forward to what lies ahead.
