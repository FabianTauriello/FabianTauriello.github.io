A very warm welcome to my blog. Here, I will document my progress and thoughts on various software projects as I work on them. You can expect to see projects covering many technologies as I refine my skills with Java and C++. Eventually, I may explore other areas but initially my focus will be on these areas. 

<br>Any blog post unrelated to a project will be placed under the “General” category in the sidebar. Otherwise, it will be placed under the “Project Updates” category in the sidebar.

<br>Ultimately, the purpose of this website is to document my growth and experience in software development. I look forward to rapidly growing my skill set with the imminent commencement of my first project. I hope you find my work compelling enough to join me on this journey.
