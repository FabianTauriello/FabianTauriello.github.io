Over the last year I've spent a lot of time tinkering with the Android ecosystem. I've built several Android apps using Kotlin, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> (e.g "COVID-Tracker", and "Movie Catalog"). This has allowed me to get familiar with the tools and environment, and begin working on an Android implementation of Hiya. So, as promised, that's exactly what I did. HOWEVER, Kotlin is the recommended/supported language for Android applications according to Google so I'm afraid Java has been sidelined. Fortunately, Kotlin was quite simple to learn. I don't find it that different from Java but it's much better in some key areas: less boilerplate, and null safety to name a couple. 

<br>Here are some images of Hiya (as an Android app) in action:

<br>![chat log](../../../../images/Hiya/update5-chat_log.png)

<br>While it's not even close to being finished, the basics are there and I feel that I have a good understanding of what is required and which direction to take. The final project will utilise most (if not, all) of the following libraries/features:
<br><br>
- Firebase (for authentication, and recording user information and messages)
- MVVM architecture
- Data Binding
- View Models
- Coroutines
- Room
- Android's Navigation Component
- Recycler View

<br>Lastly, I'm not satisfied with building just another chat app. I want to release Hiya to the store so I want to build something truly unique. I have some ideas that I'll share in my next post, but for now, you'll have to settle for the pictures above.
