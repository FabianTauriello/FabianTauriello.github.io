To kick things off, I’ve decided to experiment with Sockets in Java by creating a multi-client chat program called ‘Hiya’, named after the informal greeting I’ve heard a lot since arriving in the UK. The project will go through several iterations as I improve things and add new features but let’s start with an early list of my requirements... 

<br>Hiya should:
1. Follow the client-server paradigm, where multiple clients can connect to a server and communicate with each other over some protocol.
2. Allow clients on the same network to communicate with each other. 
3. Allow text communication.
4. Have a graphical user interface (GUI).


<br>Remember, this list only represents a simple list of minimum requirements that should be considered. It may be revisited in the future to change or add new requirements. For instance, requirement 2 could be improved by allowing clients on different networks to communicate with each other. 

<br>I’ll be using the Eclipse IDE and Java version 13.0.1 to build the application.
