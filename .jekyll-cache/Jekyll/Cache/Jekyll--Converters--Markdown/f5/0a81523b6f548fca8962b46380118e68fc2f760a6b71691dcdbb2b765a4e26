I"7<p>Over the last year I’ve spent a lot of time tinkering with the Android ecosystem. I’ve built several Android apps using Kotlin, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account (e.g ‘COVID-Tracker’, and ‘Movie Catalog’).
As promised, I’ve been working on building Hiya for Android.</p>

<p>Check out the repository <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/Hiya-Android">here</a>.
Note, you can also click on “Hiya” under “Project Updates” to see the repository.</p>
