I"—<p>I realize itâ€™s been a long time since I posted to my blog but I have good reasonsâ€¦</p>

<p><br />Since the middle of March, Iâ€™ve been honing my skills in Android development with the aim of ultimately deploying Hiya (the chat application I discuss in other blog posts), and becoming a professional Android developer. This is the direction I want to move forward in - <strong>Android development</strong>.</p>

<p><br />Iâ€™ve experimented with a number of technologies and libraries to achieve these goals but it will take more time before Iâ€™m comfortable and ready to build Hiya. I want to make sure Hiya is built with clean, well-structured code that uses the latest libraries and best practices. In the meantime, Iâ€™ve pushed a few Android apps to my GitHub account and for now; Hiyaâ€™s development is suspended as I continue to work on these smaller projects. I have a lot of time to improve my skills in Android development given the current global situation and I feel good about my progress so far.</p>

<p><br />When I first started this blog, I wasnâ€™t sure what type of developer I wanted to be. But now I know. I look forward to what lies ahead.</p>
