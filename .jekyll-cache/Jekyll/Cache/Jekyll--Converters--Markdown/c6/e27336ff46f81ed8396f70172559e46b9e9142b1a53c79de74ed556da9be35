I"†<p>Here is some footage of Hiya in action. Itâ€™s still in the early stages of development but I have a lot of ideas and itâ€™s (slowly) coming together each day.</p>

<p><br />
A few notes about what youâ€™re about to see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homerâ€™s phone (right) begins with the phone already logged in and ready to go</li>
  <li>Fabianâ€™s phone (left) begins at the login screen</li>
  <li>After logging in, the user is presented with four tabs in the bottom navigation view:
    <ul>
      <li>In-progress: stories that are not finished. Userâ€™s can still add text to the story and make other changes</li>
      <li>Finished: once an author is happy with the story, they can check the â€œtickâ€ button in the action bar. If both authors have ticked this button, the story will be marked as â€œfinishedâ€ and listed in this tab. Text changes can no longer occur. They can mark it as a â€œlikedâ€ and it will appear in the Liked tab.</li>
      <li>Liked: lists all liked stories</li>
      <li>Profile: allows a user to sign out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fabian starts a story with Homer Simpson. The list of users Fabian can choose from are determined by his phone contact list AND if they have an account with Hiya.</li>
  <li>At this point, the story log screen opens and each â€œauthorâ€ takes turns, writing one sentence at a time to build a fictional story. From this screen, the author can also open the story into â€œfull-screen modeâ€, mark the story as â€œdoneâ€, or make changes to the storyâ€™s details (e.g. title and genres/tags)</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Important note: play both videos at the same time to see how the app updates realtime.</p>
