I"Å<p>A very warm welcome to my blog. Here, I will document my progress and thoughts on various software projects as I work on them. You can expect to see projects covering many technologies, including, but not limited to, embedded software and the blockchain. I‚Äôm also determined to refine my skills with Java and C++. Eventually, I may explore other areas but initially my focus will be on these areas.</p>

<p><br />Any blog post unrelated to a project will be placed under the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù category in the sidebar. Otherwise, it will be placed under the ‚ÄúProject Updates‚Äù category in the sidebar.</p>

<p><br />Ultimately, the purpose of this website is to document my growth and experience in software development. I look forward to rapidly growing my skill set with the imminent commencement of my first project. I hope you find my work compelling enough to join me on this journey.</p>
