I"U<p>To kick things off, I’ve decided to experiment with Sockets in Java by creating a multi-client chat program called ‘Hiya’, named after the informal greeting I’ve heard a lot since arriving in the UK. The project will go through several iterations as I improve things and add new features but let’s start with an early list of my requirements…</p>

<p><br />Hiya should:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the client-server paradigm, where multiple clients can connect to a server and communicate with each other over some protocol.</li>
  <li>Allow clients on the same network to communicate with each other.</li>
  <li>Allow text communication.</li>
  <li>Have a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
</ol>

<p><br />Remember, this list only represents a simple list of minimum requirements that should be considered. It may be revisited in the future to change or add new requirements. For instance, requirement 2 could be improved by allowing clients on different networks to communicate with each other.</p>

<p><br />I’ll be using the Eclipse IDE and Java version 13.0.1 to build the application.</p>
