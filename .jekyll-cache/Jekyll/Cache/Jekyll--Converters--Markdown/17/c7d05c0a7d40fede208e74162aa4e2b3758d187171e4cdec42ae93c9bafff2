I"¡<p>Over the last year Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time tinkering with the Android ecosystem. Iâ€™ve built several Android apps using Kotlin, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> (e.g â€˜COVID-Trackerâ€™, and â€˜Movie Catalogâ€™). This has allowed me to get familiar with the tools and environment, and begin working on an Android implementation of Hiya. So, as promised, thatâ€™s exactly what I did. HOWEVER, Kotlin is the recommended/supported language for Android applications according to Google so Iâ€™m afraid Java has been sidelined. Fortunately, Kotlin was quite simple to learn. I donâ€™t find it that different from Java but itâ€™s much better in some key areas: less boilerplate, and null safety to name a couple.</p>

<p><br />Here are some images of the app in action:</p>

<p><br />While itâ€™s not even close to being finished, the basics are there and I feel that I have a good understanding of what is required and which direction to take. Speaking of directionâ€¦.Iâ€™m not satisfied with building just another chat app. I want to release Hiya to the store so I want to build something truly unique. I have some ideas that Iâ€™ll share in my next post, but for now, youâ€™ll have to settle for the pictures above.</p>
