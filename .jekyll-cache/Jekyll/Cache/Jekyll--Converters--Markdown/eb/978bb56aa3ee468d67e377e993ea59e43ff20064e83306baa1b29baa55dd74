I"“<p>Over the last year Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time tinkering with the Android ecosystem. Iâ€™ve built several Android apps using Kotlin, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> (e.g â€œCOVID-Trackerâ€, and â€œMovie Catalogâ€). This has allowed me to get familiar with the tools and environment, and begin working on an Android implementation of Hiya. So, as promised, thatâ€™s exactly what I did. HOWEVER, Kotlin is the recommended/supported language for Android applications according to Google so Iâ€™m afraid Java has been sidelined. Fortunately, Kotlin was quite simple to learn. I donâ€™t find it that different from Java but itâ€™s much better in some key areas: less boilerplate, and null safety to name a couple.</p>
