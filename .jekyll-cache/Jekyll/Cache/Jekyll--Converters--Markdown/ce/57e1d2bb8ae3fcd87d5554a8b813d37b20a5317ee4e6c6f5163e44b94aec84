I"'	<p>Over the last year I’ve spent a lot of time tinkering with the Android ecosystem. I’ve built several Android apps using Kotlin, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/FabianTauriello/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> (e.g ‘COVID-Tracker’, and ‘Movie Catalog’). This has allowed me to get familiar with the tools and environment, and begin working on an Android implementation of Hiya. So, as promised, that’s exactly what I did. HOWEVER, Kotlin is the recommended/supported language for Android applications according to Google so I’m afraid Java has been sidelined. Fortunately, Kotlin was quite simple to learn. I don’t find it that different from Java but it’s much better in some key areas: less boilerplate, and null safety to name a couple.</p>

<p><br />Here are some images of Hiya (as an Android app) in action:</p>

<p><br /><img src="../../../../images/Hiya/update5-chat_rooms.png" alt="chat rooms" />     <img src="../../../../images/Hiya/update5-contact_list.png" alt="contact list" /></p>

<p><br /><img src="../../../../images/Hiya/update5-chat_log.png" alt="chat log" /></p>

<p><br />While it’s not even close to being finished, the basics are there and I feel that I have a good understanding of what is required and which direction to take. The final project will utilise most (if not, all) of the following libraries/features:</p>

<p><br />Firebase (for authentication and recording user information)</p>
<ul>
  <li>MVVM architecture</li>
  <li>Data Binding</li>
  <li>View Models</li>
  <li>Coroutines</li>
  <li>Room</li>
  <li>Android’s Navigation Component</li>
  <li>Recycler View</li>
</ul>

<p><br />Lastly, I’m not satisfied with building just another chat app. I want to release Hiya to the store so I want to build something truly unique. I have some ideas that I’ll share in my next post, but for now, you’ll have to settle for the pictures above.</p>
